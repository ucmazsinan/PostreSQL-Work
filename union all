/*  

By default union prevents duplicate rows from being displayed. For example insert penguin into both tables
but penguin is not duplicated in the output . To preserve duplicates, you must use union all as shown:

*/

insert into aquatic_animal(animal_name, water_temprature)
values('penguin',-36.4);

insert into terrestrial_animal(animal_name,running_speed)
							  values('penguin', 1.6);
                
--result showing one times

   select animal_name from aquatic_animal
union
select animal_name from terrestrial_animal
order by animal_name;

--result displayed two times penguin
select animal_name from aquatic_animal
union all
select animal_name from terrestrial_animal
order by animal_name;
